# FJSP-AOA-ROA-Mean-Flow-Time
SOLVING FLEXIBLE JOB-SHOP SCHEDULING PROBLEM TO MINIMIZE MEAN FLOW TIME USING ARITHMETIC OPTIMIZATION ALGORITHM AND RAO-1 ALGORITHM


The arithmetic optimization algorithm is a novel meta-heuristic algorithm. Meta- heuristic algorithms generally use randomness to determine the optimal solution for a
wide range of problems as they can handle complex and nonlinear problems with large search spaces and find the global optimal solutions. To solve arithmetic problems, the suggested AOA method relies on the use of arithmetic operators.


Rao algorithms are straightforward metaphor-free and tuning parameter-free optimization algorithms proposed by Rao (2020). After testing these algorithms on various optimization problems, Dr Rao claims that they give an effective solution to diverse optimization problems. However, the efficiency of these algorithms for difficult optimization problems is yet to be determined. The present work also focuses on improving and applying the Rao-1 method to solve FJSP, a complicated optimization problem, to minimize the mean flow-time, and comparing the results with those of other State-of-the-art models available in the literature review.
